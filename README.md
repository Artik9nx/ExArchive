# ExArchive
ExArchive is an archiver designed to simplify working with files. Similar to WinRAR, it allows you to create .zip archives from folders and individual files. However, ExArchive's functionality isn't limited to just archiving. The built-in viewer allows you to view text files and explore the contents of jar files, which can be useful for developers. ExArchive is a convenient tool for everyday file management.
